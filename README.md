This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# General Info/Purpose 
This application is a project planner, and where users can create an account, login, and post new projects to the application. The notifications component tracks new projects created, along with new users that create an account in the app. The theme of my app is Mario Bros. to give it some taste and creativeness.
